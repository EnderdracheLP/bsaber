                "text": "The time has come, symphonic. I'm finally reviewing a map of yours. BRACE YOURSELF!!\n\nBut before I get into the mapping, I absolutely need to comment on how well done the environments are and how amazing the storytelling in the song is. The first word that comes to mind when experiencing this is \"magical\". Elecast, I'm sure you've already been told this plenty, but what the hell, this is MAGNIFICENT!! Had me smiling like an idiot!\n\nGetting into the actual mapping, I played both the Expert+ and Hard difficulties. I normally only play the Ex+, but I do have a (maybe weird) reasoning for this.\nWhen I played Ex+, if I'm being *brutally honest*, I came out of it very... mixed. While I think sym plays around with some fun pattern ideas in the highest diff, I think the biggest thing I noticed was *very inconsistent emphasis and representation*. What I mean by this is that the map seems to at random points switch focus from the instrumentals to the vocals, and it was really distracting and hard for me to get a grasp on what the map was trying to **be** in the first place. There were definitely some angles that were hard to read as they weren't indicated as good as they could have been, and it made it difficult for me to invest myself and get lost in this quite frankly beautiful song and experience. \n***HOWEVER.***\nIt did not sit right with me to come out of this map feeling sour. A lot of what I thought sym was trying to represent gave me thoughts of how it might work better in a lower difficulty, so I decided to then immediately try the Hard, and *bang*, I was right on the money. I REALLY liked the Hard difficulty; it felt like everything was far more consistent, there's this little pattern (0:53) that I thought was super cute and fun, and pretty much erased the complaints I had with Ex+, so my recommendation for my personal optimal experience of this map would be the Hard difficulty. Oh no I'm running out of space I'm about to hit the 2k character limit YOU BOTH DID GREAT",

Everything about this map is incredibly satisfying in both the mapping and the lightshow. Phoenix's diffs already can be quite challenging, so I am looking forward to trying the guest diffs as well at a later time. Spinvvy's I'm pretty sure I can handle, but we'll see if I can get past even 30 seconds of whatever evil GalaxyMaster has cooked up.",

One day. Rest is about Phoenix's top diff. Might try Spinvvy's diff some day.\n\nOne that I haven't seen anybody mention is that the custom environment for some reason kinda looks like it's slanted upwards. I think it's because of the placement of the scores. This made me super confused and my first play of the map I had lots of misses because I couldn't judge distance properly. I played it again with environment override and that felt way better.\n\nAnd yeah, I think the wrist roll chains, while they can work, are a bit abused in this map. Some of them are not really setup properly and they just feel incredibly forceful and shitmissy.\n\nAlso, Phoenix, we all know you love windows, but some windows in this map really felt \"too inverted\", to the point where I missed quite a few of the first notes of the windows because my hand just wasn't in a position to hit them properly.\n\nOther than that, though, this map is really, really good. And there is a lot of good to talk about. I'm going to pick the variety to pinpoint. This map has a lot of variety in pattern styles, speed, difficulty, intensity of hits, usage of bombs, different types of hits... and most of it (except for the above) work really well and add to the representation. While Phoenix maps are generally quite good, they do tend to fall into a certain familiar pattern of alternating leans, windows and certain types of movement. This one has a lot of that, but also has a lot of stuff that's beyond that.",

I certainly think this map deserves multiple plays to see all the different takes on this song.\n\nAlso, holy shit, these lights??? Even with playing this four times in a row, I couldn't grasp all the insane detail Phoenix and Timeweaver put into this.

Timeweaver's Ex+ is spicy and dynamic, no holding back on representation and it provided a fun challenge, as someone who struggles with techy angles. Alex's Ex+ is less angley but just as fun and replayable, featuring his signature curved sliders. \n\nIf I wanted to nitpick, I think NJS could probably be knocked down 1 on both Ex+ diffs. Probably could even get away with 16 on Weaver's, ngl. I also kinda preferred the intro on the playtest version of Weaver's, but I understand why he nerfed it. The backhand bomb reset was cool but not easily sightreadable. I can only imagine the downvotes are from people who can't play light tec, and don't realise there's another difficulty that they can play.",

Alex never disappoints with how fantastic his representation is and Timeweaver showcases just how masterclass he is when it comes to V3 lighting. Some of their best work in my opinion, really combining the strengths of both of these mappers for one BANGER mapset. Highly recommend checking this map out, as well as Time and Alex's other works!",

At first I was worried the lighting was going to be a bit too blinding but I could always see what was coming and it ended up being perfect! Patterns and mapping felt great in the standard V2 diffs and the use of arcs in the lawless V3 diffs made for a great addition. I do wish the NJS was lowered by 2 on each diff since 20 on the top felt excessive for me, but overall, very deserving of Map of the Week. Great job to both Dirty Alex and Zyxi! Definitely one of the best maps I've seen this year.",

I was shocked after the (very beautifully lit) intro when the first notes hit - but the patterns were so damn good, I ... this is the first \"flail your arms wildly\" map that I cleared with an S rank.\nGreat flow, great patterns, great song, great lighting. I love this map!\nThank you!!\n\nOriginal review on BeastSaber by the_ecips",

Even though migraines are all but gone, this is just pain to experience even with custom colors in use and caused one.\n\nCharting is quite good overall even if downmaps go towards bit boring and safe which is fine and through my bias but the overuse of arcs in E+ for example really does nothing but detract from the experience..\n\nOriginal review on BeastSaber by aaltopahwi",

Every hit flows naturally into each other, with smooth walls that guide you to a grooving time. I really enjoyed how the chorus is mapped in particular, with a very cool 1-2 pattern!\nThe mapping concept carries over into the lowers, creating a great mapset for all skill levels! Don't be afraid to try the lowers, they're great if you're looking for a more dancey experience 💖\nBytrius' lights are amazing as well, very well done both of you! Truly an award winning mapper collab\"\n\nOriginal review on BeastSaber by alice",

In the calmer sections, the lighting feels like lights under water. While in the drop, the energy of the mapping and lights both rise signifcantly. This makes for a very noticable contrast between these sections. The lower diffs are made well so this is a very accessible map.\n\nThe difficulty of the map is a bit higher than what the low NPS may suggest. The song has a number of calmer sections where the mapping is much less dense so prepare for the drop.\n\nOriginal review on BeastSaber by xace1337manx",
