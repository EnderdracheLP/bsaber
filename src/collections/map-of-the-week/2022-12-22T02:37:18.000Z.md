review: |-
    Really well-made map all around. I love the representation and flow of the map! The patterns are interesting and difficult without feeling unnecessarily difficult or badcutty. I wish there was  a bit more preparation for the one hand jump burst sections in the ex+, but overall pretty minor issue.
