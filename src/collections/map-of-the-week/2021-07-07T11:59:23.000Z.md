    __Flows Like Water__
    
    A nice relaxing map. The lighting complements the map incredibly well. The different sections of the song are represented well. In the calmer sections, the lighting feels like lights under water. While in the drop, the energy of the mapping and lights both rise signifcantly. This makes for a very noticable contrast between these sections. The lower diffs are made well so this is a very accessible map.
    
    The difficulty of the map is a bit higher than what the low NPS may suggest. The song has a number of calmer sections where the mapping is much less dense so prepare for the drop.
