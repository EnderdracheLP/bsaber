review: |-
  Great map! I could definitely feel Poland's influence throughout, felt like a lighter version of something they would make. Loved the decorative wall use too, never felt like it was in the way of anything.
  I've mentioned this to you already, but I think some of the emphasis on the intial kicks on drops could've been pushed a little harder. Some of those 3-wides (imo) could've been made wider just to add some more impact to the more intense parts of the song. But that's a very small nitpick, great job overall!
