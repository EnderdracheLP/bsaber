review: |-
  An unexpected dance USAO map!!

  All diffs of this are the poster child of timbo circles. the little looping motions in every diff is what makes these set of maps a joy to play (yes, even in the normal diff!!!)

  the little scissor motions are my favourite near the end. the horizontals also add a nice punch. lots of fun to play at every diff
