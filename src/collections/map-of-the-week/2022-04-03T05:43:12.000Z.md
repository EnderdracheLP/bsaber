  __Great fun aross techy X+ to accable Easy diffs__

  I wasn't sure about this one when I listened to the music, but gave it a try because the x+ was under 4nps and I enjoy Shad mapping & lights.
  The mapping stands on its own. As does the lightshow. Put them together and you have an excellent map.

  For me, one great thing about tech maps is that the fun in the challenge of reading & playing them is not always indicated by the nps. There are some amazing tech maps that are in the 3 to 5 nps range and are a blast to play for me, even if I can't pass the top diffs.
  This is one of the best on the lower end of the nps range. The X+ is a solid diff with fun and expressive patterns that kept me smiling all the way through. The lowers are all excellent downmaps with the difficulty progression well reflected in simplified patterns. The Easy is a good acc map for us players who have not broken into the 4 digits of rank yet, but could have had a little more horizontal play in it.
  I did find a few of the mapping choices for vocals in the lowers just a but tricky and swung early or late, but that's a skill issue that is a fair challenge for us casual players.

  Thank you for another delightful map, Shad.
