review: |-
    The map fits the song incredibly well, have had a blast the few times I've played it now. Very fun map overall.
    Found the dodge walls a bit harsh on the first playthrough, but they don't feel nearly as harsh after that point. Kind of wish those few bombs towards the end didn't have chroma effects on them as well as it disables the bomb coloring tweak from Tweaks55 (I find the default bomb color way, way too dark), but that's a minor nitpicky thing.
