review: |-
    Mapping is really solid throughout and showcases a lot of intuitive flow between patterns. The map does a good job at feeling concrete in it's style so you can learn what to expect without knowing what's to come. Representation is really well executed, especially during the chorus representing the lyrics. The lights are super fun and are the right balance of attention seeking while not being distracting. Very fun overall!
