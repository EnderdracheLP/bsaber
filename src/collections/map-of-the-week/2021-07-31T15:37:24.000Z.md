    __Good play!__
    
    No clue what Justin is on about; these were some solid maps! Not only did the easier levels have a somewhat higher NJS than usual, they also feel one step harder than their name suggests (Easy felt like Normal, etc.). Otherwise, I had a lot of fun playing these! Nice lights too!
