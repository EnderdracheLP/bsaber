review: |-
    Map is very fun. Lightshow looks great and at the time was the first time i'd really seen a lightshow like this that plays with light and dark very smoothly. Lowers remain accessible for those that can't handle the top diff, and the Expert+ has very fun dance ideas in the mapping throughout. I really liked the bomb resets that could also be played as wrist rolls.
