review: |-
  Well crafted and enjoyable map set. I can quite easily get headaches when turning lights on for beatsaber, however no such problems here on my playthrough of ex+, and the lights complement the mapping nicely.

  Huge props to Byte for the really engaging and fun mapping as always. Simple, yet very well done representation and flow. I liked the funky 90 degree streams towards the end though they felt ever so slightly inconsistent at times. The sway back and forth, and side to side patterning really suits the song and the rhythm choices in most places felt really nice to play and fit the music.

  Overall would very much recommend this map set.
