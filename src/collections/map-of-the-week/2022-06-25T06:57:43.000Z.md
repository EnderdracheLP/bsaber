review: |-
  The mapping in this chart is really fun to play through. The amount of dancy and techy bits throughout that not only feel great to play but fit the representation of the song in very unique ways that aren't seen too often is always enjoyable to me. The lighting of the song did feel somewhat lazy at times but still does a good job at acting as a sort of background noise to the mapping which remains enjoyable.
