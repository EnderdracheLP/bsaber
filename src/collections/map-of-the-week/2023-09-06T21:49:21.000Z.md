    I don't care who you are, if you don't just naturally start dancing when you hear this song are you really even human? So glad DeeDee made this! Well represented patterns; I especially liked the chain use on the "one, two, three" section. Also, perfect environment choice and lighting to match the song! Happy that Spooky was able to help out! Nice job, DeeDee!!
