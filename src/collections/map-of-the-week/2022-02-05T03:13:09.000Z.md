    __Dancey, accessible map!__
    
    Joshabi's signature wall-heavy style returns with yet another great collab with Bytrius! Every hit flows naturally into each other, with smooth walls that guide you to a grooving time. I really enjoyed how the chorus is mapped in particular, with a very cool 1-2 pattern!
    The mapping concept carries over into the lowers, creating a great mapset for all skill levels! Don't be afraid to try the lowers, they're great if you're looking for a more dancey experience ðŸ’–
    Bytrius' lights are amazing as well, very well done both of you! Truly an award winning mapper collab"
