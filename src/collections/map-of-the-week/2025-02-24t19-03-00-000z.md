review: This map has a epic lightshow in which the song lyrics are written with
  the pillars, and the map itself is at a very good quality, too. Patterns
  represent each sound of the song well, yet not being too hard so that many
  players can enjoy it. Overall, this map can be recommended for many people to
  enjoy both map and lightshow. <i>-Curator symphonic</i>
