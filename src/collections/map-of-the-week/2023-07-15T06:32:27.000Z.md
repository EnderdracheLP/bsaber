review: |-
    its clear that a ton of effort was put into this with the stunning custom environment, lights, etc, but i just have a few gripes with the main (phoenix) diffs. i will say that i think most people will enjoy it a lot more than i did and think it still deserves to be given a try by everyone. wasn't sure whether to give neutral review here but eh. because it's objectively fine and there are enjoyable diffs (and the insane environment / lighting), it shall be green.
    
    phoenix ex+ diff: very cool use of long arcs here that the player actually has to follow to hit the next set of doubles properly. good representation, arcs during the 2:25 - 2:57 section are neat. well... i didnt mind the map until the last drop with those dot inlines... then you decided to make them arrows on the next stream (which, to my ear, sounds the same as the dot inline stream).. if you'd made them all arrows i think i wouldn't be bothered. i also just hate how shitmissy chains are (especially wrist roll chains) and by extent its hard to have fun with maps that use them so often. the bombs and stacks during the buildup can be a little jarring on sightread. you could say skill issue has influenced my impression a bit but /shrug
    
    update: they're all dots now.....
    
    spinvvy diff: typical spinvvy map, which is to say good, accable and inoffensive. don't have much to say on it other than it was a little more stammy than expected for one of her maps.
    
    galaxymaster diff: this diff looks absolutely insane when played correctly. unfortunately, i cannot play it correctly. can hardly play it at all for that matter, but it is sick as hell and a lot of the ideas are very interesting. 300 bpm (justified) jump spammage with heavy tec. if you have the skill you gotta give it a shot
    
    in any case thank you for bringing for more of Teminite's bangers to the community and i encourage people to play this. if you dont enjoy the other diffs then Spinvvy's should be fine for 99% of people
