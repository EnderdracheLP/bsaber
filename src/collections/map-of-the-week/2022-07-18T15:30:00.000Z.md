    Absolutely amazing map that earned it's status as historic. The lighting was unlike anything the community had seen at the time and still holds u p near flawlessly with the fast paced developments of V3 lighting. The mapping itself does an amazing job in it's emphasis making use of a lot of tricks in the book to be unique the entire way throughout.
