  __Break a Sweat for sure!__

  This map was a lot of fun! Excellent song choice to go with the fitbeat style which certainly did not let up or give you a break; but what do you expect from fitbeat maps anyway?! Patterns were spicy to keep you engaged and certainly to keep you sweating. Great job, Scarladore! Definitely enjoyed this one!
