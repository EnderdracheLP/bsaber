review: |-
  Great integration of the Cinema with the Fall Out Boy environment, and good lighting to really glue that together. The mapping is very nice as well. Standard is comfy and interesting, and the one-saber is more challenging but has great tech and movement in its patterns. A well-deserved Map of the Week.
