review: |-
  Holy shit. Downloaded this song as part of the album and I was not prepared for this level. But it's mapped so well, meaning that while it seems just as difficult or more difficult than any other "really hard" level, it looks twice as impressive and is twice as much fun to play.
  This is the kind of map I am MORE than happy to surrender my arms to. I can live with noodles for a day.
