    __Great flow!__
    
    I'm a mediocre player at best, setting songs to "hard" is truly "hard" for me to even get through to the end.
    This map however ... I was shocked after the (very beautifully lit) intro when the first notes hit - but the patterns were so damn good, I ... this is the first "flail your arms wildly" map that I cleared with an S rank.
    Great flow, great patterns, great song, great lighting. I love this map!
    Thank you!!
