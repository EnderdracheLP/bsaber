review: |-
  Now this is the collab of the century! Alex never disappoints with how fantastic his representation is and Timeweaver showcases just how masterclass he is when it comes to V3 lighting. Some of their best work in my opinion, really combining the strengths of both of these mappers for one BANGER mapset. Highly recommend checking this map out, as well as Time and Alex's other works!
