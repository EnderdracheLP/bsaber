  __ARRR!__

  This is one of my favorite maps EVER! Gorgeous light show, almost too pretty for such a playful song. The patterns are really fun, though I feel like there's a few wonky rhythm spots here and there (though this could be my inexperience). When I show off Beat Saber to friends, this is the map I show them. SEND THEM TO THE DEPTHS!
