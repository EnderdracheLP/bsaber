**About this Event:** "It's officially the warmest time of the year (if you live in the northern hemisphere, that is) and we are excited to announce the start of our first ever Summer Contest! Interested in taking part?

Unlike our holiday themed contests, which come with their own themes by default, the summer contest is going to be a bit unique in that it will have a specific theme assigned each year! This year, we are starting off strong with a classic **BEACH DAY/SUMMER NIGHTS** theme!"

Eligible categories are:

- Standard Maps
- Visual Experience Maps
- Gameplay Experience Maps
- Models (Sabers, Platforms, Avatars, Notes & Walls)
