# The 2024 Beasties

Our Beasties Finalist Team of roughly 30 community members with exceptional knowledge and skill in mapping and lighting best practices have completed their incredibly hard task of sifting through a record-breaking 1,141 unique submissions for this year's BeastSaber Mapping Awards! We'll post statistics on the submissions and more after the Awards show!

We couldn't have accomplished this as smoothly as we did without the incredible work by [Saeraphinx](https://saera.dev/) who voluntarily offered to create an entirely new site and database to host the submission and voting logistics - instead of going through Google Forms and using Google Sheets to try to go through everything. This, in addition to collaboration with [Top_Cat]() from BeatSaver, as well as [NSGolova]() and [LightAi]() from BeatLeader, who allowed us to use their authentication abilities and helped to promote the Beasties, ended up drawing the most submissions we have ever received! We are truly greatful for their contributions! Consider supporting [BeatSaver](https://www.patreon.com/BeatSaver) and [BeatLeader](https://www.patreon.com/BeatLeader) through their respective Patreons!

This year also included lots of help from some wonderful people in the JP Community who helped write [an entire guide on the Beasties in Japanese](https://fancy-heath-653.notion.site/The-Beasties-10ac696bffca80a79826f47be321b15c), in addition to helping to translate the submission and voting pages on Searaphinx's Beasties site we used. We wanted to shout out the work from [Okyou](), [mochichi](), and [Ge2toro]() for getting that together!

Lastly, we need to shout out the work done by [RateGyro]() who, for the second year in a row, has taken the reins over for this monumental project and has continued to keep The Beasties alive! Wrangling together everyone, from the Finalist Team and making sure everyone completes the finalist selections, to the Show Helpers and making sure content creation is handled is no small task. Rate poured a huge amount of his personal time into this and we are super thankful for him!

If you see any of these dedicated community members mentioned above around the community, be sure to send them some love and thanks for us!
