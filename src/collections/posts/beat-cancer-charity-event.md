**About this Event:** The legendary panda Gio is assembling a huge team in the sunny Milano this December. To make a lot of pasta? Yes... but there is more! This will be a part of one of the biggest charity streams in Beat Saber's history.

On the 7th and 8th of December, he is running a fundraising event for the [Pancreatic Cancer Action Network](https://pancan.org/), which is a foundation dedicated to research on pancreatic cancer and helping the people affected by it.

Tune in to watch about 20 prominent community members livestream matches, tournaments, interviews, cooking shows and much more, all throughout the weekend. Let's gather as many donations to help bonk one of the nastiest diseases of humanity from existence and have fun while doing it!

Top donors will receive badges on their [BeatLeader](https://beatleader.xyz) profiles, and every donor will get an achievement. BeatLeader will also be cooking up an event on their website in the week before the livestream, so stay tuned for that!
